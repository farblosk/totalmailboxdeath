# use

* ensure webdriver is up to date
* unzip + run main.py through an IDE

# on adding new websites

you are welcome to add websites to list.txt! please see discussions on the criteria they have to meet. 

# on proxies

i didnt implement a proxy here, although for most selenium applications id highly recommend a proxy to avoid captchas and a bad fingerprint. 
> free proxies are always unsafe. i recommend using a paid rotating proxy or using a free tor alternative.
